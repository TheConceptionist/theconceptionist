You probably know me for  \r\n## TopHat,\r\nwhich is probably the best feat in programming I have made so far. That other people can use, anyway.  \r\n  \r\n# Other stuff I do\r\nI work for Mack (@Sven65) as a developer for Discord Dungeons, which is a thing that he's making. I'm less of a developer, and more of a guy that figures out if stuff works. So that's nice.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n# My stuff\r\n### [TopHat](https://github.com/TheConceptionist/TopHat)",
